      "> Recursion is a pretty fundamental and important concept in algorithms. It involves the divide and conquer strategy where we break a problem into smaller and smaller peices until it becomes trivial.\n",

      "> There are pros and cons with recursion, the main advantage is that recursion can sometimes provide a simple and elegant solution to a complex problem. The disadvantage is that it could be computationally expensive. The important concept with recursion is to know when to use it and when to avoid it.\n",
